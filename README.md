React Native w/ Redux <br />

## Architecture of the project

Since Redux was used to develop this project : the true architecture of the project is a bit more complex than that but the closest type of app design we can get to using Redux is a **MVC** architectural pattern : 
<ul>
    <li>Model : these are on a redux-based project the <strong>reducers</strong>, they control the data and set their values</li>
    <li>View : the React Native code of course</li>
    <li>Controller : the <strong>actions</strong>, they dispatch the actions triggered by the users</li>
</ul>
